Gemini for level creation (replayability / non deterministic levels): https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-js#readme

Overworld could also be console based?

Generated levels are "beyond the black wall", "inside the wall" levels are pre-designed. Could be different areas are "gang" or "corp" dominant and have certain themes like being sentry-ICE heavy, or Daemon heavy or whatever.

Main story could be something like trying to find a body control implant chip, so you can be bio again. Maybe you're a scan of a person who lost their body to an AI from beyond the wall or something like that. You get a decision to retake your body or give it to someone else who had a similar fate? Idk

Stats could all be from slotted programs. Or Firmware. Maybe Firmware takes a slot but only gives passives, and Programs can be active.

RAM: Commands can cost RAM, which reduces current immediately. Once the program (or daemon, or whatever) is finished, then the RAM goes into "reallocating", which the player can then convert into "available" at a rate of X/turn. So it's not an immediate refund of RAM cost, and its not a single consumption with static gain per turn.
